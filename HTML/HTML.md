# Basic HTML Elements

A webpage is made from elements, similar to a Lego house assembled from blocks. The elements are created and organized using HTML (hyper text markup language). Every page on the internet is made of code, saved as an HTML document. When you visit a website in your ```browser```, you're opening an HTML file.

The HTML file is a text file with the ```.html``` extension. The files contain code.

**3.2 Demo Activity: Button Example**

Join me working through a real-world example.

This is a **button** with text:

Ready to write code to create a button? Let's do it!
To create this button, you will write the following code in an HTML file.

```
<button>Hi! I'm a button with text</button>
```

<iframe src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/intro-to-web-button?embed=1&file=index.html" style="border:0px #ffffff none;" name="button" scrolling="no" frameborder="1" marginheight="0px" marginwidth="0px" height="400px" width="600px" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Did you notice a construction with angle brackets (< >)? These brackets are referred to as **HTML tags**, used to describe **elements** on a website. For example; buttons are created with a pair of ```<button></button>``` tags:

Most tags come in pairs, like hands. The opening <button> tag tells the browser where the element begins. While the closing </button> tag specifies where it ends. Text between the <button> and </button> tags will be displayed on the button itself.
- This text can vary. For example, we can write "Send" or "Sign up" and then place this button wherever it's needed. We can also make a "Let's go!" button and place it right here:
